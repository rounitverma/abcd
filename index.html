            One of the most affected victims of the pandemic are children who now have no access to schools. While a lot of children
            have the means for online classes, underprivileged children are still deprived of learning as they have no access to
            computers or smart phones. These children already have had difficult journeys, having fought the shackles of poverty,
            child labour, and much more to finally reach school. But the pandemic has reversed their years of struggle.

            For lakhs of such children, education has come to a halt. They can't afford smart phones, can't count on support of
            parents for home learning. Shiksha Na Ruke is a Smile Foundation initiative that is providing underprivileged children
            access to continuous learning. Despite everything, they have not given up on education, they continue to dream. Join
            hands with us to help these little dreamers continue their education.
